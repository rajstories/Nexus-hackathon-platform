# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Currently supported versions:

| Version | Supported          |

| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Fusion X seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT Create a Public Issue

Security vulnerabilities should not be reported through public GitHub issues.

### 2. Email Security Team

Send details to: security@fusion-x.dev

Include:
- Type of vulnerability
- Full paths of affected source files
- Steps to reproduce
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact assessment

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 5 business days
- **Resolution Target**: 30 days for critical, 90 days for low severity

## Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization

- Firebase Authentication for user management
- JWT token verification on all protected routes
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Session management with secure cookies

### API Security

```javascript
// Current implementation
- Helmet.js for security headers
- Rate limiting: 100 requests/10 minutes/IP
- CORS with strict allowlist
- Input sanitization and validation
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries
```

### File Upload Security

- File type validation (MIME type checking)
- File size limits (50MB maximum)
- Executable file blocking
- Path traversal prevention
- Virus scanning (in production)

### Data Protection

- Encryption at rest (database)
- TLS/SSL for data in transit
- Sensitive data masking in logs
- Secure password hashing (bcrypt)
- Environment variable protection

## Security Headers

```javascript
// Implemented via Helmet.js
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
```

## Known Security Considerations

### Third-Party Dependencies

- Regular dependency updates via Dependabot
- Security audit via `npm audit`
- License compliance checking

### Infrastructure Security

- Azure App Service with managed SSL
- Azure SQL with firewall rules
- MongoDB Atlas with IP allowlist
- Azure Blob Storage with SAS tokens

## Security Checklist for Contributors

Before submitting code:

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Input validation on all user inputs
- [ ] Output encoding to prevent XSS
- [ ] Parameterized database queries
- [ ] Proper error handling (no stack traces to users)
- [ ] Authentication checks on protected routes
- [ ] Rate limiting on resource-intensive operations
- [ ] Logging of security events
- [ ] Tests for security features

## Security Testing

### Automated Testing

```bash
# Run security tests
npm run security:test

# Check for vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Static analysis
npm run lint:security
```

### Manual Testing

1. **Authentication Testing**
   - Invalid token handling
   - Session expiration
   - Privilege escalation attempts

2. **Input Validation**
   - SQL injection attempts
   - XSS payload testing
   - File upload bypass attempts

3. **API Security**
   - Rate limit verification
   - CORS policy testing
   - Authorization boundary testing

## Incident Response

### Severity Levels

1. **Critical**: Remote code execution, data breach
2. **High**: Authentication bypass, SQL injection
3. **Medium**: XSS, CSRF, session fixation
4. **Low**: Information disclosure, minor vulnerabilities

### Response Process

1. **Identification**: Confirm and assess the vulnerability
2. **Containment**: Implement immediate mitigation
3. **Eradication**: Deploy permanent fix
4. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
5. **Lessons Learned**: Update procedures and documentation

## Security Updates

Security updates are released as:
- **Patches**: For critical vulnerabilities
- **Minor versions**: For high/medium vulnerabilities
- **Major versions**: For architectural security improvements

## Compliance

We aim to comply with:
- OWASP Top 10
- GDPR (for EU users)
- SOC 2 Type II (planned)
- ISO 27001 (planned)

## Security Tools

### Recommended Tools

- **OWASP ZAP**: Web application security testing
- **Burp Suite**: Security vulnerability scanner
- **SQLMap**: SQL injection testing
- **Nmap**: Network security scanning

### VS Code Extensions

```json
{
  "recommendations": [
    "snyk-security.snyk-vulnerability-scanner",
    "trufflehog3.trufflehog3-scan",
    "humao.rest-client"
  ]
}
```

## Bug Bounty Program

Currently, we do not offer a bug bounty program, but we deeply appreciate security researchers who:
- Follow responsible disclosure
- Provide detailed reports
- Suggest remediation steps

Recognition will be given in:
- Security advisories
- Hall of Fame page
- Release notes
