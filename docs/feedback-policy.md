# Judging & Feedback Policy

## Transparency & Guidelines for Fair Evaluation

### Public Information
- **Rubric**: All evaluation criteria and scoring rubrics are publicly visible to participants before and during the event
- **Judging Process**: Teams can see which judges are assigned to evaluate their submissions

### Judge Requirements
- **Constructive Feedback**: Judges must provide at least one constructive comment per submission they evaluate
- **Quality Standards**: Comments should be specific, actionable, and help teams understand their scores
- **Professional Conduct**: All feedback must be respectful and focused on the work, not personal attributes

### Feedback Privacy & Release
- **Initial Privacy**: All judge feedback and scores remain private to the team until the designated release time
- **Release Timeline**: Feedback becomes visible to teams at the time specified by `feedback_release_at`
- **Team-Only Access**: Once released, feedback is visible only to the team members - it is never made public
- **No Public Scores**: Individual scores and detailed feedback are never displayed publicly to maintain team privacy

### Clarification Process
- **48-Hour Window**: Teams have 48 hours after feedback release to request clarifications
- **One Message Limit**: Each team may send only one clarification message per submission
- **Direct Communication**: Clarification requests go directly to the assigned judges
- **Response Timeline**: Judges should respond to clarification requests within 24 hours when possible

### Appeal Process
- **Organizer Review**: Teams may appeal scores through the event organizer if they believe there was an error in evaluation
- **Documentation Required**: Appeals must include specific concerns about scoring discrepancies or policy violations
- **Final Decision**: Organizer decisions on appeals are final
